# switch-atmos-downloader
A bash script that automatically downloads latest Atmosph√©re, Hekate, sigpatches and Tinfoil Installer and puts them into a folder and a ready to use .zip file. Public AIO builds are hosted [here](https://aio.adamski2003.ga).
# Usage
The script runs in interactive mode when ran without any arguments. If you pass a path as an argument, it switches to non-interactive mode - check the variables in the script for settings.
